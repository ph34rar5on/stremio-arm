# stremio-arm

Script that builds Stremio on armhf/arm64

Build to work on Ubuntu, but should also work on Debian

It also install nodeJS using NVM, but only if its missing

It downloads the stremio icon from their website and stores it to the hicolor theme (fallback theme of most DEs), it should work but if not copy the icon from:
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/stremio.png
to your theme
